            <hr>

            <img class="bio-image" src="assets/images/me.jpg" alt="Kong Le">

            <p>My name is Kong Le and I was born in Vietnam. I moved to America with my family when I was 6 years old.
                Within a couple years I earned one of the top spots having the highest math score in my school. As I
                grew up I started taking interests in music and art. I build on my creative side by drawing, painting,
                and playing the piano. I was good at everything I do. I enjoyed them but they weren't my passion.</p>
            <p>In high school I took an interest in programming. I started to learn the fundamentals of programming by
                drawing lines and dots on a programmable calculator to make a picture. I took a web design class but it
                only showed me how to build a webpage through drag and drop. Once I was done I was able to view what the
                code was for that particular page. However, I could not understand this "foreign" language. I went to
                college to learn more about it but that wasn't enough to fulfill my dream of being a programmer. So I
                finally decided to sign up for the UCF coding bootcamp.</p>
